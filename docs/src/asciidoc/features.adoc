=== Unsupported Constraints
- http://grails.org/doc/latest/ref/Constraints/scale.html[scale]
- http://grails.org/doc/latest/ref/Constraints/validator.html[validator] - custom validators can have all kinds of business logic in them and there isn't a programmatic way to interrogate this.  If the test value that's tried doesn't pass your logic, you'll need to provide a value, or mock out the calls that the validator makes so that it passes.
- http://grails.org/doc/latest/ref/Constraints/unique.html[unique] - not directly supported but it's possible to specify your own unique value in a config file as demonstrated on the link:examples[Examples] page.
- http://grails.org/doc/latest/ref/Constraints/notEqual.html[notEqual] - unlikely that our test data would match this, could be supported in the future
